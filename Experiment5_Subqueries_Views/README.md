# Experiment 5: Subqueries and Views
## NAME : VISHAL C
## REGISTRATION NUMBER : 212224100062

## AIM
To study and implement subqueries and views.

## THEORY

### Subqueries
A subquery is a query inside another SQL query and is embedded in:
- WHERE clause
- HAVING clause
- FROM clause

**Types:**
- **Single-row subquery**:
  Sub queries can also return more than one value. Such results should be made use along with the operators in and any.
- **Multiple-row subquery**:
  Here more than one subquery is used. These multiple sub queries are combined by means of ‘and’ & ‘or’ keywords.
- **Correlated subquery**:
  A subquery is evaluated once for the entire parent statement whereas a correlated Sub query is evaluated once per row processed by the parent statement.

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees);
```
### Views
A view is a virtual table based on the result of an SQL SELECT query.
**Create View:**
```sql
CREATE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name WHERE condition;
```
**Drop View:**
```sql
DROP VIEW view_name;
```

**Question 1**
Write a SQL query to List departments with names longer than the average length
Departments Table (attributes: department_id, department_name)
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/601b7491-6659-406c-b3ef-09a48970ea30)
~~~
SELECT department_id, department_name
FROM Departments
WHERE LENGTH(department_name) > (
    SELECT AVG(LENGTH(department_name)) FROM Departments
);
~~~


**Output:**
